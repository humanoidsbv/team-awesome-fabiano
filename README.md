# Team Awesome

Team Awesome is an online application where Humanoids employees record everything that concerns their day-to-day work.

## Features

The app allows individual employees to:

    	- hold a profile that is accessible on all pages.

    	- record worked hours on the "Timesheets" page.

    	- provide information about projects and clients on the "Team members" page.

    	- store important documents on the "Documents" page.

## Installation

For this installation Node and NPM are required. Homebrew is used as package manager and Formulae is used as package browser. If you don't have these installed yet, here's how to do it:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

```bash
brew install [package]
```

Now we can install Node and NPM:

```bash
brew install node
```

The necessary dependencies can now be installed from the package.json file as follows:

```bash
npm i
```
